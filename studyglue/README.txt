HISTORICAL NOTE
===============
The development of the initial code here in directory 'studyglue' was based 
on analysis of one version of the OGT SAS code in ...superdata/glue.sas file 
of 2012.

For posterity, file glueref.txt, also in this directory is a file that has a 
reference copy of the glue.sas code that was emulated in initially developing 
the code here in the Summer of 2013. 

File glueref/gluerefbase.html is viewable through a web browser and it has 
one SAS line number per list item at a certain heading 
level that should be obvious on inspection with comments interspersed 
all around - very much a working document.

File glurefbae.html would probably never be updated,
and its best use would be to compare those notes with the python code in
this repository and directory in code revisions in the low to mid 400's (at 
that/this time we use a Mercurial repository). 

Some of the initial python code here has comments that refer to glue.sas 
line xxx, and the line numbers used refer to those in the file 
gluerefbase.html

No effort should be made to maintain those comments or line numbers, in fact,
it may be best to remove all references to glue.sas in a few revisions hence.

The code references to glue.sas appear only for posterity, in case someone 
finds it useful to dig out the initial version of this python code and 
compare it to the SAS code that inspired the initial version.
